## Project Objectives

- Our problem at hand is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the text of the review.
  - A widely-used dataset for this task is the IMDB dataset. It contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, and preprocessed into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Notice that both sets are balanced, which means that there are equal numbers of items in both classes.
  
You will first use a high-level framework for deep learning, Keras, as the tool to build a model for this task. Keras helps us to leverage powerful backend toolkits such as Theano and TensorFlow. You may find that it is much easier to build a simple model for sentiment analysis using Keras than other complex toolkits. However, as you will see in the future courses, when the problem becomes more difficult, you need to dive into the finer mechanisms of deep learning toolkits.
