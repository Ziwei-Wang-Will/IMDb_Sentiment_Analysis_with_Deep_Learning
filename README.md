## Project Objectives

- Our problem at hand is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the text of the review.

## Dataset description
- A widely-used dataset for this task is the [IMDB dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/imdb). 
  - It contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, and preprocessed into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, both sets are balanced.
